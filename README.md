## Credit Detox Challenge Gameplay
In the _credit detox_ challenge you emulate a credit portfolio manager. There are a number of important concepts to go over before you can master the game. While the game itself is a simplified (and accelerated) version of reality, the underlying credit and risk management concepts are not simplified. In particular calculations are performed (where applicable) with actual libraries and tools - in this case the concentrationMetrics Library and with reference to the documentation at the Open Risk Manual.
